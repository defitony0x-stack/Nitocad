"""
x402 payment gate for NitoCAD's MCP tool - ported from Stitchfren's
app/mcp/x402.py, which is the pattern OKX's A2MCP review actually approved.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS INSTEAD OF backend equivalent: mcp-gateway/server.js
(the Node service) is NitoCAD's original A2MCP integration - a hand-rolled
REST route wrapped by the generic community @x402/evm npm package. Stitchfren
shipped an identical-shape Node gateway first and got rejected by OKX's
listing review for the stated reason "service isn't integrated with the
official OKX Payment SDK." Stitchfren's fix was this file: build the real
x402.http.middleware.fastapi.PaymentMiddlewareASGI from OKX's own Python SDK
(okxweb3-app-x402), mounted directly on the FastAPI backend, instead of a
separate Node service calling the generic TypeScript SDK. This file is that
same fix, ported to NitoCAD. mcp-gateway/ should be decommissioned once this
path is verified live - see its own file for the deprecation note.

UNVERIFIED, flagged rather than guessed at - same discipline the mcp-gateway
Node rewrite used for its own SDK-shape guesses:
  - PaymentMiddlewareASGI's constructor signature and RouteConfig/
    PaymentOption's exact field names are carried over from Stitchfren's
    working file, not re-derived from reading okxweb3-app-x402's installed
    source - I don't have network access in this environment to
    `pip install okxweb3-app-x402` and confirm them directly.
  - Whether a dollar-string price ("$0.50") resolves cleanly against OKX's
    own facilitator for eip155:196 the same way it did in Stitchfren's
    deployment is inferred from Stitchfren's working code and comments, not
    independently re-verified against a live call from here.
Do one real paid call against this in staging before trusting it in
production, and if PaymentMiddlewareASGI's constructor rejects any of these
kwargs, paste the TypeError back - it'll name the actual accepted signature.
