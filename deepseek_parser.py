"""
DeepSeek-based parameter extraction from natural language descriptions.

This restores the actual "LLM as brain" architecture that smart_parser.py
quietly abandoned, smart_parser.py is pure regex/keyword matching, no
language model involved at all, despite the project's own stated design
principle (LLM parses intent, deterministic templates do the geometry).
This module is real LLM parsing; the templates and validator remain
exactly as before, untouched, still doing all the actual geometry work.

UNVERIFIED IN THIS ENVIRONMENT: no internet access and no DeepSeek API
key available here, so this has not been run against the real API. It's
written against DeepSeek's current, documented OpenAI-compatible API
(base_url="https://api.deepseek.com", model="deepseek-v4-flash" or
"deepseek-v4-pro", current as of this build, DeepSeek has changed model
names before, see the note in api-docs.deepseek.com if this stops
working). Test with a real key before trusting this in production.

If the description doesn't clearly match any of these, set part_type to "unknown" and confidence to 0.0.
If a parameter isn't mentioned, omit it (the template applies its own default), don't guess a specific value for something the description didn't say.

Also extract, if mentioned:
- material: one of aluminum_6061, aluminum_6063, aluminum_7075, steel_1018, steel_4140, stainless_304, stainless_316, brass_c360, copper_c110, bronze_phosphor, titanium_ti6al4v, plastic_abs, plastic_pla, plastic_nylon, plastic_delrin, wood_plywood, wood_mdf
- operations: a list of {"type": "fillet"|"chamfer"|"shell", ...} for any fillet/chamfer/shell mentioned that isn't already a named parameter above

Respond with ONLY valid JSON, no markdown fences, no explanation, in this exact shape:
{
  "part_type": "...",
  "parameters": { ... },
  "material": "..." or null,
  "operations": [...],
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0
